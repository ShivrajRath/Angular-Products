            "The screen on this phone is beautiful. It is large and crisp but doesn't feel so bulky even with a tough case. I do mostly texting on the phone so I use the keyboard a lot and that's the only fault I can say this phone has for now. The home button is placed right under the space button which means if your typing quickly you will inevitably hit the home button at some time. I've always had an iPhone so this was never a problem so I would say other than that this phone is great. Battery last all day, I've had this phone for about a mouth and it has NEVER died on me like my iPhone would constantly do. Games are also awesome on this. It has unique features that I wouldn't say are great but they work. If they find a way to hide the bottom home screen while typing it will be great or else I would definitely go back to Apple when the new iPhone 6 comes out. The speakers are similar to those of the iPhone which I'm used to so I don't complain and the camera is great on this phone. Don't take much pictures but the ones I have came out really good."
